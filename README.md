# CS255 Portfolio – Business Requirements & System Design

*A portfolio submission for CS 255, showcasing my DriverPass business requirements and system design.*

## Artifacts
- **Project One:** Business Requirements Document — `CS 255 PROJECT ONE.docx`
- **Project Two:** System Design Document — `CS 255 System Design Document Module 7.docx`

## Reflection

### 1) Project Summary
The client was **DriverPass**, a company helping students prepare for DMV driving tests. They wanted a **web-based system** where students can create accounts, choose training packages, take practice tests, **schedule/cancel lessons**, and track progress. Staff (secretary/admin/IT) need tools for **user management, driver/vehicle assignment, and content updates**.

### 2) What I Did Well
I translated the interview into **clear functional + nonfunctional requirements** and kept the documents **structured and traceable**, so every feature ties back to a user need.

### 3) What I’d Revise
I’d **tighten the UML** (cleaner labels, simpler relationships) so non-technical readers can follow it faster and devs have less ambiguity.

### 4) Interpreting User Needs
I mapped needs (scheduling, DMV content, progress tracking, roles) into concrete features and **role-based access**. Designing from user needs matters because a technically “correct” system is useless if it doesn’t solve real user problems.

### 5) Design Approach & Future Strategy
Approach: capture goals → derive requirements → model with UML → define technical requirements.  
Next time I’ll add **iterative reviews, user stories, and lightweight prototypes** earlier to validate assumptions sooner.
